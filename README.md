DESCRIPTION
This web page allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and it runs and confirms whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all.

#BDD
The Program gives feedback of 3 values that are Equal; Input Example :side A = 13 side B = 13 side C = 13 Output Example:This is an  Equilateral Triangle

The Program gives feedback when only 2 values are Equal; Input Example : side A =13 side B =13 side C =8 Output Example: This is an Isoscelese Triangle

The Program gives feedback when all values are unequal; Input Example:side A =7 side B =8 side C =9 Output Example: This is a Scalene Triangle

The Program  when the three values don't form a triangle;
Input Example :value(a)=6 value(b)=7 value(c)=15 Output Example: This is not a Triangle.
